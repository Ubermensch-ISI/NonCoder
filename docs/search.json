We will diagnos it graphically using Histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Histogram it is evident that the data is not coming from a Normal population . Still we fit a GBM to see how it work.\n\n\nModel fitting:\n\nMethod of Moment estimates:\nHere we estimated the parametres of GBM using MOM estimates. We found,\n\nParametre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParametre\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\\[                       \n      \\mu                  \n      \\]\n-0.00208\n\n\n\\[                       \n      \\sigma               \n      \\]\n0.1468849\n\n\n\n\n\nFit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodness of fit test:\nHere we are calculating the Chi- Square statistic based on a simulated path.\n\n\nP-Value:  0\n\n\nHere the p-value for the test is coming as 0. That means the data is not fitting well in this case.\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimates:\nSimilarly as above but using MLE estimates of the GBM we fit it with our data. The estimates are,\n\nParametre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nParametre\n\n\n\n\n\\[                             \n         \\mu                     \n         \\]\n-0.00208\n\n\n\\[                             \n         \\sigma                  \n         \\]\n0.14687\n\n\n\n\n\nFit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComaparison between two methods of estimation\nMOM and MLE is performing almost equally in this data. The chi square test statistic for MOM is 1091429 whereas the value for the MLE is 1429156. So we may conclude that MOM estimate is relatively better working then MLE estimate.\n\nGoodness of fit :\nSimilarly as above,\n\n\nP-Value:  0\n\n\nThe p-value is coming to be zero. Hence the fit is not good which is also evident from the plot itself.\n\n\n\n\nJump Diffusion Model:\nFrom the plot of the data , we can see that there is several jumps in the data. So for modelling this kind of data, Jump Diffusion Model is very famous in literature.\nHere the SDE is,\n\\[\ndS_t=\\mu S_tdt+\\sigma S_tdW_t+JS_tdN_t \\], where \\(N_t\\)~ Poisson process with parametre \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(J\\) represents the jump size. Here we are modelling that, \\(J\\) follows logNormal(\\(\\mu_J,\\sigma_j\\))\n\nFit:\nThe fitting process involves three steps,\n\nFix a threshold, in practice 3- \\(\\sigma\\) limits are taken.\nValue of the price greater than the threshold are used to estimate the parametres for \\(J\\) and \\(N_t\\) . But we did’nt get reasonable output there. So we fine tune it to work better.\nValue of the price lesser than the threshold are used to estimate the other parametres. Here also we took the same approach .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodness of fit:\n\n\nP-Value:  0\n\n\nHere also the Goodness of fit Chi- Square test is giving p-value zero, hence the null hypothesis that the data is fitting the model is rejected."

Now we will discuss about the two methods seperately.\n\nGBM:\nGBM usually simulate data to be increasing manner. So its highly unlikely for real world data to get fitted well. But if the time interval is very small or the time gap between two observation is fairly large , then it can be assumed that there is not such jumps in that case. So we can assume that in that case GBM may be a good fit to the data. Actually, for stable market GBM works well. Here our log return was far from normality and also we had some jumps in the data, so the GBM approach failed.\n\n\nJump Diffusion Model :\nIn literature , Jump Diffusion Model and its extensions are widely used for modelling the data with jumps. But here we are using the basic model. It is capturing the jump but due to high variability it is not efficient.\n\n\nClustering:\nWe tried KNN clustering also. It was giving us two clusters, one in the first and last with relatively high values and one in the middle with the low values. We may extend it to model this clusters seperately."
